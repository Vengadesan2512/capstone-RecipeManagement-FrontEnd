# React + Vite

n the Recipe Management project, users can register, login, and logout. They can also add recipes, save recipes, and view detailed ingredient information for each recipe. Each user has a separate profile section where they can see the recipes they've added. Authentication is implemented to ensure that recipe data can only be saved or added by logged-in users. This project utilizes React, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, MongoDB, and Node.js.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
